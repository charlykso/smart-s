# Test script to verify the Fee Collection NaN fix
echo "üß™ Testing Fee Collection NaN Fix"
echo "=================================="

echo ""
echo "‚úÖ Issue Identified:"
echo "- Backend was not calculating or returning 'collectionRate' in financial data"
echo "- Frontend was trying to access dashboardData.financial.collectionRate"
echo "- Math.round(undefined) or Math.round(null) returns NaN"
echo "- NaN% was being displayed in the Fee Collection stat"

echo ""
echo "üîß Backend Fix Applied:"
echo "- Updated principal_view.js controller"
echo "- Added collectionRate calculation: (totalRevenue / totalExpectedFees) * 100"
echo "- Added proper handling for cases with no fees"
echo "- Added outstandingFees calculation"

echo ""
echo "üîß Frontend Fix Applied:"
echo "- Added safe formatPercentage() function to handle null/undefined/NaN values"
echo "- Added safe getCollectionRateColor() and getCollectionRateDescription() functions"
echo "- Updated Fee Collection stat to use safe formatting"
echo "- Updated Outstanding Fees alert to use safe formatting"

echo ""
echo "üìä Expected Results:"
echo "Before: Fee Collection shows 'NaN%'"
echo "After:  Fee Collection shows '0%' or calculated percentage"

echo ""
echo "üß™ Testing Steps:"
echo "1. Restart backend server (taskkill old process first)"
echo "2. Login with principal@smart-s.com / password123"
echo "3. Check Principal Dashboard Fee Collection stat"
echo "4. Verify it shows a valid percentage (0% if no data, calculated % if fees exist)"

echo ""
echo "üîç Additional Changes:"
echo "- Collection rate is now calculated based on actual fee data"
echo "- Handles edge cases like division by zero"
echo "- Provides meaningful fallbacks for missing data"
echo "- More robust error handling throughout"

echo ""
echo "Backend updated in: api/controller/principal_view.js"
echo "Frontend updated in: frontend/src/components/dashboard/roles/PrincipalDashboard.tsx"

echo ""
echo "Note: Backend restart required to see the changes"
