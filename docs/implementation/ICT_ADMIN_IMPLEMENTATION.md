# ICT Administrator School Management System

## Overview

This document outlines the implementation of the ICT Administrator functionality for the Ledgrio School Accounting System. The ICT Admin role has specific permissions and capabilities for managing schools and users within their assigned Group School.

## üéØ Key Requirements & Implementation

### 1. ICT Admin Restrictions ‚úÖ

- **CANNOT create GroupSchool**: ICT Admins are restricted from creating new group schools
- **CANNOT modify ICT_administrator or Admin users**: Security restriction to prevent privilege escalation
- **Scope limited to Group School**: Can only manage resources within their assigned group school

### 2. School Management Capabilities ‚úÖ

- **Create schools under same GroupSchool**: ICT Admin can create new schools within their group
- **Manage multiple schools**: Dashboard view of all schools under their group school
- **School CRUD operations**: Create, read, update, and delete schools (with restrictions)
- **Automatic GroupSchool association**: New schools are automatically linked to ICT Admin's group school

### 3. User Management Capabilities ‚úÖ

- **Create users in managed schools**: Can create users across all schools in their group
- **Role restrictions**: Can create Principal, Bursar, Teacher, Student, Parent roles only
- **Multi-school user management**: Manage users across multiple schools simultaneously
- **User status control**: Activate/deactivate users, reset passwords

## üé® Frontend Architecture

## üîß Backend API Implementation

### School Management Routes (`/api/schools/`)

#### GET `/by-group`

- **Purpose**: Fetch all schools under ICT Admin's group school
- **Authentication**: Required (ICT_administrator role)
- **Response**: Array of schools with user counts
- **Security**: Validates ICT Admin's group school association

```javascript
// Example Response
{
  "schools": [
    {
      "_id": "school_id",
      "name": "Smart School Academy",
      "email": "info@smartschool.edu",
      "phoneNumber": "+1234567890",
      "isActive": true,
      "groupSchool": {
        "_id": "group_id",
        "name": "Smart Education Group"
      },
      "userCount": 45
    }
  ]
}
```

#### POST `/`

- **Purpose**: Create new school under same group school
- **Validation**: Email and phone uniqueness, required fields
- **Auto-assignment**: GroupSchool automatically set from ICT Admin's context
- **Security**: Prevents group school modification

#### PATCH `/:schoolId`

- **Purpose**: Update school information
- **Restrictions**: Cannot change group school association
- **Validation**: Email/phone conflict checking
- **Security**: Verifies school belongs to ICT Admin's group

#### DELETE `/:schoolId`

- **Security**: Group school boundary enforcement

### User Management Routes (`/api/users/`)

#### GET `/managed-schools`

- **Purpose**: Fetch users from all schools under ICT Admin's group
- **Filtering**: Excludes ICT_administrator and Admin users
- **Population**: Includes school information
- **Sorting**: Most recent users first

#### PATCH `/:userId/status`

- **Purpose**: Toggle user active/inactive status
- **Restrictions**: Cannot modify ICT_administrator or Admin users
- **Security**: Group school validation

#### PATCH `/:userId`

- **Purpose**: Update user information
- **Restrictions**: Cannot change sensitive fields (password, \_id)

## üîê Security Implementation

### Authentication & Authorization

#### Middleware Stack

```javascript
const auth = require('../middleware/auth')

// Route protection
router.get(
  '/by-group',
  auth.authenticate, // JWT token validation
  auth.authorize(['ICT_administrator']), // Role-based access
  controller
)
```

#### Group School Boundary Enforcement

```javascript
// Validate ICT Admin's group school association
const ictAdmin = await User.findById(req.user.id).populate('school')
if (!ictAdmin.school || !ictAdmin.school.groupSchool) {
  return res.status(400).json({
    message: 'ICT Admin not associated with a group school',
  })
}

// Verify target resource belongs to same group school
const targetSchool = await School.findOne({
  _id: schoolId,
  groupSchool: ictAdmin.school.groupSchool,
})
```

### Role-Based Restrictions

#### User Creation Limitations

```javascript
const allowedRoles = ['Principal', 'Bursar', 'Teacher', 'Student', 'Parent']
const restrictedRoles = ['ICT_administrator', 'Admin']

// Prevent privilege escalation
if (!allowedRoles.includes(requestedRole)) {
  return res.status(403).json({
    message: 'Not authorized to assign this role',
  })
}
```

#### User Modification Restrictions

```javascript
// Prevent modifying higher-privilege users
if (user.roles.includes('ICT_administrator') || user.roles.includes('Admin')) {
  return res.status(403).json({
    message: 'Not authorized to modify this user type',
  })
}
```

## üì± User Experience Design

### Dashboard Header

- **Context Display**: Shows current group school name prominently
- **Statistics**: Live counts of managed schools and total users
- **Role Clarity**: Clear indication of ICT Administrator permissions

### Navigation

- **Tab-based Interface**: Clean separation between Schools and Users management
- **Active State Indicators**: Visual feedback for current tab
- **Consistent Icons**: Heroicons for professional appearance

### Responsive Design

- **Mobile-first Approach**: Tables scroll horizontally on mobile
- **Grid Layouts**: Responsive school cards (1-3 columns based on screen size)
- **Modal Optimization**: Scrollable modals for smaller screens

### User Feedback

- **Toast Notifications**: Success/error messages for all actions
- **Loading States**: Spinners during API calls
- **Empty States**: Helpful guidance when no data exists
- **Confirmation Dialogs**: Prevents accidental deletions
