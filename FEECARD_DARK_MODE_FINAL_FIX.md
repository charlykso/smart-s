# Final Fee Management Dark Mode Fix Summary

## Issue Resolved âœ…

**Problem**: The approve button section and other parts of fee cards were showing white backgrounds in dark mode, making them unreadable and inconsistent with the overall dark theme.

**Root Cause**: The `FeeCard.tsx` component was missing dark mode variants for several key sections:

- Actions footer section (`bg-gray-50` without dark variant)
- Approve button colors
- Text colors throughout the component
- Status badges and borders

## Final Solution Implemented

### FeeCard.tsx Complete Dark Mode Update

**Actions Section (Bottom of Card)**:

- `bg-gray-50` â†’ `bg-gray-50 dark:bg-gray-750`
- Added `border-t border-gray-100 dark:border-gray-700`
- Approve button: `bg-green-100 dark:bg-green-900 text-green-700 dark:text-green-300`
- Edit/Delete buttons: Added `dark:hover:bg-gray-700` and `dark:hover:bg-red-900`

**All Text Elements**:

- Fee amounts: `text-gray-900 dark:text-white`

- Inactive badge: `bg-gray-100 dark:bg-gray-700 text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-200`
- Status indicators: `text-green-600 dark:text-green-400` and `text-yellow-600 dark:text-yellow-400`

**Borders and Dividers**:
