## STUDENT FEE PAYMENT PAGE - ERROR FIXES COMPLETE

### âœ… ERRORS FIXED

#### 1. JSX SYNTAX ERRORS

- **Issue**: Duplicate closing tags around lines 287-291 were breaking JSX structure
- **Fix**: Removed duplicate `</p></div></div></div>` tags
- **Result**: JSX now parses correctly

#### 2. TYPE SAFETY IMPROVEMENTS

- **Issue**: TypeScript errors due to mismatched types
- **Fixes Applied**:
  - Added `dueDate?: string` to Fee interface in `types/fee.ts`
  - Removed unused imports (`CreditCardIcon`, `FunnelIcon`)
  - Changed `any[]` to `Payment[]` for payments state
  - Changed `any` to `Fee` for selectedFee and handlePayFee parameter
  - Removed unused `totalFeesAmount` variable

#### 3. COMPONENT PROP COMPATIBILITY

- **Issue**: StudentFeeCard and PaymentHistoryCard expected different data structures
- **Fix**: Added data transformation to match expected interfaces:

  ```tsx
  // For StudentFeeCard
  fee={{
    _id: fee._id,
    name: fee.name,
    amount: fee.amount,
    type: fee.type,
    term: typeof fee.term === 'string'
      ? { _id: fee.term, name: 'Unknown Term' }
      : { _id: fee.term._id, name: fee.term.name },
    // ... other properties
  }}

  // For PaymentHistoryCard
  payment={{
    _id: payment._id,
    amount: payment.amount,
    fee: typeof payment.fee === 'string'
      ? { _id: payment.fee, name: 'Unknown Fee', ... }
      : { _id: payment.fee._id, name: payment.fee.name, ... },
    // ... other properties
  }}
  ```
