# Outstanding Fees Calculation Fix - COMPLETE

## Issue Description

The student dashboard was incorrectly showing "Outstanding Fees: ₦0" when there were actually ₦25,000 in unpaid fees. This was misleading students about their payment obligations.

## Root Cause Analysis

The issue was in the backend `student_view.js` controller in the `getStudentDashboard` function:

1. **Limited Scope**: The calculation was only looking at fees for the current active term
2. **Missing Logic**: It used `termFees` instead of all approved fees for the school
3. **Payment Status**: It wasn't filtering payments by success status

### Original Problematic Code:

```javascript
// Only got fees for current term
termFees = await Fee.find({
  term: currentTerm._id, // ❌ Limited to current term only
  isApproved: true,
  isActive: true,
})

// Got all payments regardless of status
const payments = await Payment.find({
  user: studentId, // ❌ Included failed/pending payments
}).populate('fee', 'name amount type')
```

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Fixed Fee Scope

Changed from current term fees to ALL approved fees for the student's school:

```javascript
// Get ALL approved fees for the student's school
allApprovedFees = await Fee.find({
  school: student.school, // ✅ All school fees
  isApproved: true,
  isActive: true,
})
```

### 2. Fixed Payment Filtering

Only count successful payments:

```javascript
const payments = await Payment.find({
  user: studentId,
  status: 'success', // ✅ Only successful payments
}).populate('fee', 'name amount type')
```

### 3. Enhanced Calculation Logic

```javascript
const paidFeeIds = payments.map((p) => p.fee._id.toString())
const outstandingFees = allApprovedFees.filter(
  (fee) => !paidFeeIds.includes(fee._id.toString())
)

const totalOutstanding = outstandingFees.reduce(
  (sum, fee) => sum + fee.amount,
  0
)
const totalPaid = payments.reduce((sum, payment) => sum + payment.amount, 0)
```

## Results

### Before Fix:

- **Outstanding Fees**: ₦0 ❌

- **Outstanding Fees List**: Empty ❌

- **Outstanding Fees**: ₦25,000 ✅
