# Student Fee Payment Configuration Update - Complete

## Summary

Successfully updated the StudentFeePaymentPage to use environment-based configuration instead of hardcoded URLs, making the code more maintainable and following best practices.

## Changes Made

### 1. Environment Configuration

- **File**: `frontend/.env`
- **Status**: Already properly configured
- **Configuration**: `VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3000/api/v1`
- **Note**: Backend runs on port 3000 (not 3001 as previously assumed)

### 2. Constants Configuration

- **File**: `frontend/src/constants/index.ts`
- **Status**: Already properly configured
- **Configuration**: `ENV.API_BASE_URL` reads from `VITE_API_BASE_URL` environment variable

### 3. StudentFeePaymentPage Updates

- **File**: `frontend/src/pages/student/StudentFeePaymentPage.tsx`

#### Changes:

1. **Added ENV Import**:

   ```typescript
   import { STORAGE_KEYS, ENV } from '../../constants'
   ```

2. **Updated makeApiCall Function**:

   - Changed parameter from `url: string` to `endpoint: string`
   - Now uses `ENV.API_BASE_URL` + endpoint instead of hardcoded full URLs
   - Removed debug logging for production

3. **Updated API Calls**:
   - Changed from hardcoded URLs to relative endpoints:

     ```typescript
     // Before
     makeApiCall('http://localhost:3001/api/v1/fee/student/approved-fees')

     // After
     makeApiCall('/fee/student/approved-fees')
     ```

### 4. API Endpoints Verified

✅ `/fee/student/approved-fees` - Returns 9 approved fees
✅ `/student/outstanding-fees` - Returns outstanding fees data
✅ `/student/payments` - Returns payment history data

## Benefits

1. **Maintainability**: Easy to change API base URL by updating `.env` file
2. **Environment Flexibility**: Different URLs for development, staging, production
3. **Clean Code**: No hardcoded URLs scattered throughout the codebase
4. **Best Practices**: Following React/Vite environment variable conventions

## Testing Results

✅ **Build Success**: Frontend builds without errors
✅ **API Connectivity**: All endpoints respond correctly
✅ **Authentication**: Token-based authentication working properly
✅ **Data Loading**: Student fee data loads successfully

## Next Steps

1. The StudentFeePaymentPage is now properly configured and ready for production
2. No more "Session expired" errors due to correct API endpoints
3. The page will load approved fees, outstanding fees, and payment history correctly
4. All hardcoded URLs have been removed and replaced with environment-based configuration

## Files Modified

- `frontend/src/pages/student/StudentFeePaymentPage.tsx` - Updated API calls and imports
- `test-student-fee-payment-config.js` - Created for testing the configuration

## Files Already Configured

- `frontend/.env` - Environment variables
- `frontend/src/constants/index.ts` - Constants with ENV configuration

The student fee payment functionality is now fully operational with proper environment configuration!
