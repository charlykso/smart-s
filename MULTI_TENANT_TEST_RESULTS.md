## üîí **Security Validation**

### **‚úÖ Multi-Tenant Isolation Confirmed**

1. **School Boundary Enforcement**: Each student only sees data from their assigned school
2. **Approval Status Filtering**: Students only see approved fees, never pending ones
3. **Zero Cross-School Access**: No student can access data from other schools
4. **Proper Authentication**: All requests require valid JWT tokens with school context

## üõ†Ô∏è **Technical Implementation**

### **Key Components Fixed**

1. **Enhanced Authentication Middleware** (`api/middleware/authenticateToken.js`)

   - Now fetches full user object with school information
   - Populates school data for proper filtering

2. **School Boundary Enforcement** (`api/middleware/auth.js`)

   - `filterByUserSchool`: Filters data by user's school
   - `enforceSchoolBoundary`: Special filtering for students (approved fees only)
   - `checkSchoolAccess`: Validates school-specific endpoint access

3. **Updated Controllers**

   - Fee controllers now respect school filtering
   - Student-specific endpoints enforce approval status
   - Payment controllers filter by school

4. **Protected Routes**
   - All fee endpoints use school filtering middleware
   - Student endpoints use boundary enforcement
   - Cross-school access attempts are blocked

### **Database Schema Compliance**

- Users properly linked to schools via `school` field
- Fees linked to schools and have `isApproved` status
- Terms and sessions are school-specific
- Payments are user-specific and inherit school context

---

## üéØ **Business Rules Enforced**
