# Smart School Academy - Project Completion Summary

**Last Updated:** June 29, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ FULLY CONFIGURED AND OPERATIONAL

## 🎯 Project Overview

Smart School Academy's accounting system has been successfully configured with proper role-based access control, user management, and academic structure setup. All core functionalities are now operational with proper security boundaries enforced.

## ✅ Completed Tasks

### 1. User Management & Role-Based Access Control

- **Admin User**: System administrator with full access

  - Email: `admin@smart-s.com`
  - Password: `password123`
  - Roles: Admin, Proprietor
  - Access: System-wide access to all schools

- **School-Specific Users Created**:
  - **Bursar**: `bursar@smart-s.com` (Fee management, financial operations)
  - **Principal**: `principal@smart-s.com` (School administration)
  - **ICT Administrator**: `ictadmin@smart-s.com` (Technical support, limited access)

### 2. Academic Structure Setup

- **School**: Smart School Academy (ID: `6856ca374de0e2d916dc329c`)
- **Sessions**: 2 academic sessions created
  - 2023/2024 Academic Session
  - 2024/2025 Academic Session
- **Terms**: 6 terms created (3 per session)
  - First Term, Second Term, Third Term for each session

### 3. Security & Access Control

- **Authentication Middleware**: Verified and working
- **Role-Based Authorization**: Implemented and enforced
- **School Boundary Enforcement**: Active - users can only access their assigned school's data
- **Fee Management Security**: Bursar can create/manage fees, ICT Admin has read-only access

### 4. Database Fixes

- **Term Model**: Fixed unique constraint issue that prevented multiple terms with same names across different sessions
- **Indexes**: Dropped problematic unique index on Term.name field
- **Validation**: Updated application-level validation for proper term creation

### 5. Testing & Verification

- **API Endpoints**: All endpoints tested and functional
- **User Authentication**: All user accounts verified with successful login
- **Role Permissions**: Confirmed role-based access restrictions
- **Data Integrity**: Verified all sessions and terms are properly associated
